# FreeCAD module named EagleBRD for Importing Eagle 6.x .brd files into FreeCAD#
################################################################################

This project started in the end of 2011 as i was playing around with FreeCAD and 
the first versions of Cadsoft EAGLE 6.x. 
Some tools were available at this time (EagleUP, Eagle3D, ...) but most of them 
use SketchUp wich i don't want to use ore generate only a 3D picture which can 
not be used in further CAD modeling.

This Mod for FreeCAD should help out.

Usage:
1. Generate a folder named "EagleBRD" in the /Mod/ path of FreeCAD 
   (There should be folders like /Arch/ /Complete/ /Draft/ ...)
2. Copy all depending files into this folder 
   This should give
   .../Mod/EagleBRD/
                   |- Init.py
                   |- EagleBRD.py
                   |- /lib/
                           |- translib.xml
                           |- ...partfiles...
3. Start FreeCAD
4. Open a Eagle 6.x *.brd with FreeCAD or use drag-and-drop and drop it into 
   FreeCAD Window
5. Wait...wait...
6. Now you should get a 3D view of your PCB (or only errors and nothing else:( )
